# Crimes in India – Power BI Visualization

## Overview
This Power BI project analyzes reported crime incidents across Indian cities from **2020 to 2024**. The dashboard highlights temporal trends, city-level distribution, crime domains, victim gender distribution, and case-closure status to support data-driven understanding and decision-making.

## Objectives
- Analyze distribution and frequency of crime types across cities.  
- Identify cities with the highest reported incidents.  
- Examine victim gender distribution.  
- Assess case-closure rates.  
- Provide concise, actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Key Observations

### Incidents Over Time
- Incident counts vary between 2020 and 2024.  
- A notable rise in reports appears around **2022**, possibly due to increased reporting or post-pandemic effects.

### Top Cities (by reported incidents)
- Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai are among the highest-reporting cities.  
- Metropolitan areas show higher incident counts, reflecting population density and reporting reach.

- Map providers — Bing Maps and OpenStreetMap for geospatial visuals.

## Insights and Recommendations
- Crime concentration is highest in metropolitan cities; targeted resource allocation and reporting improvements are recommended for these areas.  
- The predominance of "Other Crimes" suggests further categorization is needed to surface specific problem areas.  
- The higher reported share of female victims warrants focused safety programs and support services.  
- Low case-closure rates point to potential process improvements in investigation and case management systems.
